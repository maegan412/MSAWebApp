**Target Persona**</br>
Age: 70 </br>
Gender: Female </br>
Diagnosis: Early stages of Alzheimer’s disease </br>
Living Situation: Retirement Village </br>
**Details of the App**</br>
As the user is currently living with the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease, they are prone to forgetting what they should be doing at any point in a day. With the routine component of the app, my app will help them remember what they are supposed to be doing at any point during the day. As the routine is something people would want to keep private, the app will be password protected. In the event that the user forgets the password, they will be able to ask the carers to reset their password. </br>
**Extensibility of the App**</br>
In order to minimise the risk of forgetting a password, the ability to use an image to unlock the app will also be investigated and then implemented. Another implementation that I would develop is the ability to view and add activities from the village’s daily schedule. This would allow residents to choose new activities, while also seeing how it fits with their current routine. I would also like to include a journal space where users can add photos, voice recordings and notes. This would be to ensure that their memories are accessible in an app they are familiar with.
